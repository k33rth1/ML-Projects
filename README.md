# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. By leveraging a dataset containing credit card transactions, we explore various techniques to preprocess the data, train a predictive model, and evaluate its performance.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the dataset (`creditcard.csv`) used for training and testing the model.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - `1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for exploring and preprocessing the dataset.
  - `2_Model_Training.ipynb`: Notebook for training the logistic regression model.
  - `3_Model_Evaluation.ipynb`: Notebook for evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report.
- **README.md**: Documentation providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - NumPy
  - scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory in the following order:
   - `1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`
   - `2_Model_Training.ipynb`
   - `3_Model_Evaluation.ipynb`

## Results
- The trained logistic regression model achieves an accuracy of 99.86% on the test dataset.
- Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are reported for both fraud and non-fraud classes.
