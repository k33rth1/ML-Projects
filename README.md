# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. By leveraging a dataset containing credit card transactions, we explore various techniques to preprocess the data, train a predictive model, and evaluate its performance.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the dataset (`creditcard.csv`) used for training and testing the model.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - `1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for exploring and preprocessing the dataset.
  - `2_Model_Training.ipynb`: Notebook for training the logistic regression model.
  - `3_Model_Evaluation.ipynb`: Notebook for evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report.
- **README.md**: Documentation providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - NumPy
  - scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory in the following order:
   - `1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`
   - `2_Model_Training.ipynb`
   - `3_Model_Evaluation.ipynb`

## Results
- The trained logistic regression model achieves an accuracy of 99.86% on the test dataset.
- Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are reported for both fraud and non-fraud classes.

# Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project aims to detect whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask or not using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset used for training and testing consists of images of people wearing masks and images of people without masks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- scikit-learn

### Installation

You can run this notebook on Google Colab by clicking the "Open in Colab" button. Ensure to install the required libraries by executing the following command:

```bash
!pip install kaggle
```

## Dataset Preparation

The dataset used in this project is fetched from Kaggle using the Kaggle API. The dataset contains images of people with and without masks.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. The final layers include fully connected layers with dropout for regularization.

## Training the Model

The model is trained using the training data split into training and validation sets. We use the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function for compilation.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the test set. We calculate the accuracy achieved by the model on the test data.

## Prediction

Finally, we provide an interface to predict whether a person in a given image is wearing a mask or not. The predicted accuracy is computed, and based on a threshold, the prediction is made.

## Results

The performance of the model is visualized through loss and accuracy plots during training. Additionally, predictions on sample images are demonstrated.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.

## Note

- The dataset used here is for educational purposes only.
- This project focuses on a simplified scenario and may require further refinement for practical applications.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your requirements. Happy coding!
